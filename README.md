# Credit_Risk_Analysis
----------------------

# OVERVIEW
----------------------
- The purpose of this challenge was to use differet (supervised) machine learning models on a data set from LendingClub to predict credit risk. We used RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, SMOTEENN, RandomUnderSampler, RandomForest, and ADA Boost

# SUMMARY
--------------------
- The six different sampling models had an accuracy range between 60% and 69%. It should be stated that the ADA Boost model scored the highest in acccuracy which means that it should be used for this particular dataset.
